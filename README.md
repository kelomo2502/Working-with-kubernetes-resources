# Working-with-kubernetes-resources

This hands-on project provides a clear and practical introduction to managing resources in a Kubernetes cluster. From understanding essential concepts to hands-on exercises like  creating, configuring, and optimizing resources such as deployments, services and understanding the syntax of YAML Files.

A Kubernetes YAML file is a text file written in YAML syntax that describes and defines Kubernetes resources. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used for configuration files. In the context of Kubernetes, these YAML files serve as a declarative way to specify the desired state of the resources such as pods, container, service and deployment you want to deploy and manage within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Basic strucuture of YAML file

YAML uses indentation to represent the hierarchy of data, and it uses whitespace (usually spaces, not tabs) for indentation.

```yaml
key1: value1
key2:
  subkey1: subvalue1
  subkey2: subvalue2
key3:
  - item1
  - item2

```
